Street Fight and The Waterpark#Sunday, October 10, 2010#Normal Dream#None#I remember being at my cousin Rodrigo's house, outside to be more exact. We were playing soccer, doing penalty shots on the street. We were playing with someone else, but I can't remember who it was, I'm not even sure if I know him in Waking Life either. Anyways, we were playing for a while, and after some time, two guys (which I don't know personally in WL, but I see them almost everyday) came out of my cousin's house, they watched us play for some time. I really don't like these guys much in WL, there's just something about them that pisses me off. Anyways, one of them started insulting me out of nothing and I got really mad, I pushed him and he pushed me back, so I punched him in the face, he got really mad and we started fighting, I kicked his ass and he was lying on the floor. The other dude, his friend was helping him out. I was about to kick his ass too but decided not to. His friend helped him get up and took him far away, they dissapeared.

Now I remember arriving at someplace where there was supposed to be a party. I remember wearing my favorite T-shirt and jeans. I entered the place, it was big, it had a backyard, and many rooms. I saw colored lights coming from one of the rooms, I entered and there many people there dancing, like in a disco. Most of them were classmates of mine when I used to be in school, I recognized alot of them. I entered the room and joined them, I saw my friend Yuki who left the country when we were in elementary, it was great to see him. Anyways, after some time, everybody left the room and went to the backyard, it happened all of a sudden and by no logical reason, I was confused but I followed.

The scene changed, we were in some sort of waterpark, with the same people on the previous scene. The water park was very jungle-like, like a combination of Sea World and Animal Kingdom. There where other people too, foreign people from different continents. I was walking in some sort of jungle-like road with my best friend Carlos, many people where walking there too. He pointed at some girls, they looked american but I wasn't sure. One girl was carrying another, her friend most likely. She was mildly injured it seemed. I went to talk to them, the injured girl wouldn't talk, she was aching too much. But the other one (who was very pretty) told me what happened to her, she also told me she didn't had a place to stay, I told her she could stay at my place (funny thing, I didn't even know I had a place either, apparently the waterpark had like cabanas, it was like a hotel too after all), she told me that it would be nice, and thanked me.

After that all of my long ago classmates and me entered what was some sort of pirate ship. There was a wave generator, but it generated Tsunamis, the pirate ship was designed to resist them though, but It was a tough and bumpy ride. It was great though, my long ago english teacher was in command, and helped everyone not to fall from the ship.

After that we all went into some sort of lab/facility which contained many other amusing stuff that you see on waterparks.#
