The cafeteria and the end#Sunday, August 22, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This dream was interesting, I remember recalling alot of it when I woke up and some time after it, but because I was running late for college I decided I would write this entry when I come back, and see how much I can still recall.

I remember being in some campus similar to La Catolica's, I remember being with Kike and Luis in some kind of cafeteria just hanging around and talking shit.

After some time in the dream, I was now at some kind of city, it was a little deserted, the buildings were collapsed and there was alot of rubble. It seemed like the end of the world just happened or was about to happen, I also remember many people taking shelter among the collapsed material.

I know I recalled alot more in the morning, but this is like everything I can recall now, I know some other small fragments but its worthless writing them down since they make no sense with the other pieces of the puzzle missing.#
