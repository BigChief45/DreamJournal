Possesion#Friday, September 10, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a really long dream, and part of it was like a nightmare, really scary some parts.

I only remember certain fragments.

I remember being in some kind of old facility, like a mental hospital. I was with my family and we were seing someone who was very ill. Out of nowhere that someone turned out to be Donia Julia, it seemed she was possessed demonically, it was scary. She was tied up to a bed, and everyone was having some sort of dinner or reunion at a room located inside the facility. I was there with other teenagers, and then Laura Valladares was there, and we made out and other stuff very normal, like if we were a couple. Then Donia Julia brooke loose and was wreaking havoc everywhere, we had to calm her down (and at this point of writing, I begin to remember certain other fragments, which I really don't know how to connect to continue the storyline, so I guess they're just scattered puzzle pieces).

Another big fragment:

I was in a building with many rooms in it, like a hotel of some sort. The building was very nice, the architecture was beautiful, it had like chineese style. The view was pretty, and the sunlight pierced the chineese styled windows and created a peaceful setting.

I remember in this fragment, escaping from church like I used to do when I was a kid, and finding Alejandra Urquia in one of the hallways of the fancy hotel.

And thats all I basically can remember well and managed to assemble correctly.#
