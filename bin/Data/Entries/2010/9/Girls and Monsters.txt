Girls and Monsters#Saturday, September 04, 2010#Lucid Dream#MILD#This was a very weird dream, it was very exciting at first, then as it progressed, it became really weird and scary at some points, it wasn't that scary because at some point I realized I was dreaming.

It started in some kind of resort similar to Animal Kingdom, I was with a group of people and there was Kelly. So we all went into some kind of house made of wood, very very beautiful. They were sitting on chairs and I was walking around the house admiring it and inspecting it. In the group there was this blonde woman who seemed very familiar, I had the feeling I've seen her before, specially in some kind of movie or something. I told her about it but she denied it, with a very dubious response and a small laughter.

I was really attracted to Kelly, so I engaged in conversation with her from time to time. We went to the house's kitchen, everyone left the house by the back door except for the blonde. I stayed with her talking to her. I really wanted to have sex with her at that exact time and place :P . Then I remember someone else coming, I can't remember who he was. After some time I had sex with the blonde, both with and without condom. Later this thing that I mentioned who came, turned into some sort of fat glutton disgusting monster, and I remember having sex with it. I was later very worried about contracting STDs and suddenly the setting changed completely.

I was at another house, apparently my brother and my mom where with me. It also seemed that Maribel lived in that house, with her mother and her sister. The house was located in the middle of a huge field, full of mud and it was nightime.

I remember making out several times with Maribel at the house. Her mom got pissed at me. Then, my brother got really pissed ( can't remember the reason) and he went over his room and got a gun, my mom got really scared and runned to the room next to it. I stood near the door waiting for him to come out and charge him, but he refused to come out and started to shoot blind shots. I saw his hand with the gun come out of the door and I charged at it trying to take his gun away, there was a struggle for some seconds and the gun accidentally got fired and hit something in my brother's closet.

The closet doors opened and you could only see darkness in it, after a while some red eyes appeared and a little monster came out, it seemed to be angry. My brother went to calm it down and put it back where it was, I asked him what the fuck was that and he never told me.

After that I found Maribel and the house and started making out with her, I took her into my room, and grabbed her by her waist and she climbed and grabbed me with her legs and arms, I threw her gently into the bed and began kissing her.  Then all of a sudden her mother screamed, we went to see what was going on. The little thing that Gabriel was keeping in his room was not that little anymore, I started growing as seconds went by.

If I'm not mistaken, it was at this point that I realized I was dreaming, just like that. No reality checks, nothing, it just "clicked" like that. I tested my lucidness and I was indeed lucid, all of a sudden I started feeling like If I was drifting away from the dream, I felt I was waking up but still with my eyes closed, I started feeling the breeze from my window and the chant of the birds in the morning. I knew I was lucid my lucidity, and my entire dream, so I tried going back and surprisingly I made it. I remembered the lucid pill and made one appear, I took one and it seemed everything was stable, for now.

I tried flying for a bit, it worked but I couldn't control it very much. Anyways, the monster grew gigantic, it tore the house appart, I couldn't find gabriel nor my mom. So I took Maribel with me and we hid someplace. The monster always found us, we hid in several places, until we hid in one place where he never found us. The monster left the place , and I finally woke up.#
