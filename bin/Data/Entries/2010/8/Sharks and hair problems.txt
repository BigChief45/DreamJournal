Sharks and hair problems#Wednesday, August 18, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a very interesting dream, very mixed and weird.

The first thing I recall is being in a beach with my family and Rodrigo, it looks like Punta Raton, it was crowded with other people. We were bathing on the shore and there was a huge giant great white besides us, but nobody seemed to notice or care. After some seconds we started daring each other on who could beat it, then the shark opened its mouth and grabbed my feet, it didnt hurt at all and somehow I managed to get it out in perfect shape, climbed the shark and hit it, the shark started swimming away making itself smaller as seconds passed.

Next we were at some kind of mall, it was very deserted and quiet. I was with Rodrigo and Gabriel, we were at a hallway and there was a portal on the middle of the hallway, a little up in the air. I can't remember much of this part though.

Another setting I do remember was being on some sort of street where I parked my car. I was going to go out with Carol Perdomo and she kept calling over and over. Suddenly Erasmo and someone else appears and we sit down on the street and chat, later on Victor Castellanos comes out and joins the chat, they ask me what is this thing I have on my hair, I didn't know, and they kept mentioning it, so I went to ask my mom and she gave me some treatment. Suddenly my cellphone starts ringing and it was Luna, I wasn't sure if I should answer when I decided myself the call was over, so I called back and some old creepy lady answers, I asked if Luna's there and she says she's not, then I just hanged up.

Then we all went into a house to chill, we were on a big room and there was a huge bed that covered most of the room and everyone was laying down. Then I see Luna coming down the little stairs that joined to the room, she stays there and she's talking with Raynieri, then she leaves. I fall asleep and the next morning Rodrigo wakes me up and tells that somethings wrong with my dad, I call to make sure it wasn't true and it wasn't. Later I call Luna ( or she calls me, I can't remember) over the cellphone, we talk a bit and I ask her if she was at my place, she said 'yes'. I asked her if she's with Raynieri and she says 'yes', after, I ask her if she's gonna sleep at my place and she replies 'no'. So we finish talking and later on we're at the deserted mall, the same hallway, with Raynieri which seemed a little drunk.

And thats all I can remember.#
