Hero#Thursday, August 05, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This dream was a bit hard to recall, actually I didn't recall much of this dream.

I remember one part of the dream consisted of me being able to fly, through the use of something, similar to a broom. I could feel the sensation when flying, specially when doing maneuveurs and turns, it felt great. The dream had some connection with World of Warcraft too.

I also remember me being inside a house, there where other people there too. The house was located in a semi-crowded neighboorhood, where cars drove by constantly.

There was something weird going on at the house, something I can't recall. Suddenly the girl goes outside and there are some kind of robbers and a shooting starts. Me having super powers start beating up and killing these men.

I also remember being in another house, some kind of refuge house. And Rodrigo was there, we had a tv in a room and alot of cats, it was dark most of the time. And he was playing world of warcraft through the tv (I should have recognized this and should have done an RC, but no luck).#
