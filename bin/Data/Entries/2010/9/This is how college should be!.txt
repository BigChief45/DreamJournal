This is how college should be!#Monday, September 27, 2010#Normal Dream#None#Another long dream, must be because I sleep too much :P

I remember the dream taking place first at the university, or at least a university. We were on our last days of classes, I remember being with my classmates Kotaro (who is also my bass player, and thats his nickname) and Otto. We were finishing our last projects which where due that same day. I remember all of us being very stressed, running from one place to another. Anyways, we finished all our work and we only needed to do one last exam. We seperated and agreed to meet at the exam classroom.

So I went to my car to put my stuff there and retrieve some other stuff I needed. Then I entered building one and went up the stairs, as I was walking I saw Silvia (a beautiful friend of mine, which I don't see much anymore),  she was walking down the stars, her eyes faced to the floor as if thinking on something. I shouted her name in a greeting way, she raised her eyes and saw me, I approached her to greet her (It is customary here in my country to greet girls with a kiss on the cheek), so when I was about to do that, she put her lips like if giving a pop kiss, I was surprised and really confused, and after some seconds passed I didn't hesitate anymore (:P) and gave her a pop kiss. We talked for a bit, her body language was very flirty (which is completely the opposite of Silvia) and she looked as pretty as always and as ever too. So we said goodbye and I kept going up the stairs, the building was so weird, it had like construction areas in it but somehow I knew I was in building One [Missed Dreamsign?]

The hallways kept getting weirder and weirder, I finally found my classroom, and got in. It was some sort of office, a small desk and a small board on the wall. Apparently we were only 3 people. Anyways the professor came and introduced himself (although I knew who he was already, he exists in WL). And after that he began assigning homework, suddenly the backdoor opened and some girls came in to talk to the professor, one girl looked very familiar ( I think she's a girl from the gym), and she started talking to me, I didn't know her but I follow her lead anyways, she started hugging me and telling me she missed me, I was still confused but kept along. The girls finally said goodbye, she gave me a big hug and left. The professor laughed, and made a comment of his youth days and girls.

Well the class was over, and I needed to head for my last exam. I kept going up the stairs again, I felt like I was lost, the building was totally different, yet this didn't seem to trigger lucidity. Also the floor I was in was deserted, nobody was here except me. After a few mins I saw Kotaro too, he seemed he was lost as well, so I yelled at him and we grouped, we kept looking for the class and we finally found it.
