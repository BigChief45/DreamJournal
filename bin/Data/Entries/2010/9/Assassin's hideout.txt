Assassin's hideout#Wednesday, September 22, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a great dream. I was sort of like an Assassin in a city. I can't remember much but what I do remember was being in some sort of camp house outside the city, in a semi-forrest. In the house where many people I knew (in my dream), there where some rooms which where pretty futuristic and technologic, it required authentication and password but somehow I knew how to get in.

Also apart from that house, there was another small house a little next to it. I didn't have any windows, just one door. And when you entered there was only a passage leading underground. The passage underground was very short, just 1 turn and when you finished the road it lead to a room (underground) that had a big bed and usual room stuff. This is where I sleeped.

I remember being in this room with Loany, it was nighttime. We were having sex for hours, It felt great to have her by my side. Then suddenly I was called to perform and erand, I left the room and spoke with someone, after done I returned to the house and decided to check the room uptsairs of the kitchen (which required password). I went inside and there where many computers there, there was also someone sitting on a chair facing the computer, he never noticed me.

Anyways when I returned to my little room underground, Loany had to leave to do some stuff. I got pretty sad but dealt with it. She left and I stayed in the room, not much later I woke up.#
