Summer and Cocktails#Saturday, October 16, 2010#Normal Dream#None#I remember being in some kind of other country with my family. The day went through and nightime arrived. We were attending a party or reunion of some sort at a restaurant/bar. We arrived and the place was not very crouded, but there was music playing, salsa, merengue and similar kind of music. I also spotted an ex of mine (lets call her A), she was sitting on a chair next to a table, so I greeted her when I saw her, then all of a sudden a girl came (I can't remember who she was but I something tells me she was a friend of mine named Pamela) to me and talked to me, I did know the girl in the dream, so I greeted her too. We went to dance, and danced until everyone started leaving, my family left except for my brother and my cousin Rodrigo. We kept dancing and A was still sitting on her chair, at times we approached the bar tender for some drinks, it was past midnight, and the place was about to close so everyone got out. ''Pamela'' had to leave so she left and I stayed outside with A, my cousin and my brother. We were waiting for our parents to pick us up, then we saw our grandma's car approaching and parking on the parking lot, we got inside the car and drived home. It was a long drive, incredibly long. Like if we crossed a state/country. It was summer at the city we arrived and everyone was wearing bathing suites and stuff. My grandma had to go pay something so we came along with her and waited, I listened to the people talk for a while. After my grandma was done, I woke up #
