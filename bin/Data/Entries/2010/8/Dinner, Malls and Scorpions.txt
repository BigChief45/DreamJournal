Dinner, Malls and Scorpions#Thursday, August 19, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a great dream, here's what I remember:

First, I was with my family, we decided to go have dinner. I was driving the car with my family and we found a cool restaurant, the parking lot was full so I parked the car in a spot almost in front of the entrance, my family got out of the car, but for a strange reason I decided to move the car to another spot, so I did, the spot wasn't very far away but it was very dark and lonely, it was scary.

Anyways, after that I was like transported to this kind of mall my family dropped me off. There weren't many people around, but I recognized Alejandro Lean so I sticked with him. I really don't like the guy so I wasn't very friendly to him, then a friend of his came and we we're just browsing around, we reached a weird store, like a clothes and shoes store, it was huge. We took a picture of ourselves and then Laura Valladares showed up, I greeted her and so did the others, but the others kept walking, and I kept talking with her. We found a place to sit, and kept talking. Suddenly she took her shirt off and was plain nude from the top, she layed on my legs and the conversation kept going. She looked so damn sexy, I didn't hesitate to touch her breasts and squeeze them hard. I started sucking on them, it felt great.

We decided to leave, so she got on her car (still topless) and so did I. We found Mafer Gomez on the road so she got on, we talked and talked and we dropped her off. Then we drove around the city for a while, and stopped at some sort of place, really weird place, it looked like an entrance to a supermarket. She dropped me off and told me we would meet later. There was a line, and you had to shower before entering the place, it was really weird but it was very cool.

So I did, and entered a small house, I went upstairs to a porch and there was a young woman sitting on a chair with a table in front and many other chairs. So I stood there, apparently the place selled scorpions, so she showed me some, they had alot, and they showed me this huge black scorpion, so I checked them out, and somehow they slipped, all of them, including the huge black one, so I was running around the house jumping because they were chasing me, and they were everywhere. The girl managed to get them. except the big one. She said she was too sacred of it and she would not touch it. 

And the dream ended there.#
