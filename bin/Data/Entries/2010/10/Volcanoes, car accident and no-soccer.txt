Volcanoes, car accident and no-soccer#Friday, October 01, 2010#Normal Dream#None#The first fragment of the dream that I remember went like this:

I was driving my car with my mom on the passenger seat. We reached a mountain of brown dirt/mud. My dad's car was parked a little high on the mountain, he told me to park it higher. So I tried, it was hard, the car wouldnt go up, so I shifted and it started to go up, it reached a point where I had to turned so I wouldn't hit my dads car, so I turned, but my car wouldn't keep going from there. My mom go out to help me with directions. I tried everything I could, but nothing. Out of nowhere, the car started going backwards, downhill and very very fast. I was no longer in the driving seat (no idea why) and without much thought I just lifted the emergency brake, I thought it would be over by the car wouldnt stop still and kept going downhill to a direction with many abysses. I opened the car of the door and just jumped, I got up quickly and runned as fast as I could following my car. The car fell to a small abyss and stoped, when I reached, the car was destroyed completely, the wheels where nowhere to be found. It was just the outside, and barely.

I returned to the mountain where my mom stayed, I was crying and I was hurt. My dad came and comforted me. I noticed there where some men at work there, and I just got even more embarrassed. After a while, we started going up the montain, it was like a volcano. We went inside, and from inside, it just turned into a whole different story, very hard to explain if not impossible.

Now the last fragment I remember:

I was driving my car, we where going to play soccer with some friends at some place, I reached the place, parked and turned the car off. My friends saw me park and approached me by the window, I greeted them and told them I still needed to change, so they went away. I changed inside my car, got out and followed them, they had entered a building, and the door was opened. I entered and saw them watching something, apparently it was a pre-school choir practice or something like that. There was a Piano and my aunt was playing it. We were at the backmost of the building, there where some judges at the back and a kid playing the guitar on the middle. There was also the choir director who was working with the kid playing the guitar, apparently the kid couldn't manage to do something ( I'm not sure what though...) and the director was trying to decide what to do.

After a while I noticed some career classmates from college, it ocurred to me that this could be a class ahead of me. So we started talking about our classes, and then an old chineese man appeared next to us and joined the conversation, he was a professor of one of the classes he mentioned he said, and after talking with him sometime he left.

And thats when I woke up.

After that I realized we never got to play soccer after all :P#
