Age of empires and dreams#Saturday, September 18, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was one of the best dreams I've had. It was so epic! It had very different stages, but I can almost only recall the last one (as almost always). It was very Age of Empire-ish. I also noticed a missed dreamsign when I woke up!

One of the fragments I remember was being in an old city, similar to Egypt. There was this phararoh, who was very similar to me, I felt a kind of connection with him in the dream. Anyways we were a group of people and we needed to pass through a gate yet the pharaoh wouldn't let us, he had very strong magical powers too. Then something happened, like someone in the group did something and distracted the pharaoh, everyone escaped. We established a camp/base and we were preparing to strike. We forged weapons and cooked food, we stored the food and carried it with us. I carried a long sword and a small dagger. This was all very similar to Assassin's Creed too. Anyways, in the landscape, you could see a few towers which  belonged to the enemy (I now didn't know if the enemy was still the pharaoh or someone else, strange!). So we went around the towers conquering them. There was alot of fighting, it was amazing, just like medieval times. Loany was with me, we needed to escape, I grabbed her hand and we escaped from a tower. Suddenly we appeared in another place, it seemed like a bar, still conserving the medieval feeling, yet there was Maria Fernanda Rubio with modern clothes, sitting on a chair near the bartender. She looked damn hot I just wanted to go there and make out with her, but after I felt I didn't, I still was holding Loany's hand, so we went out of the bar and we kept following a leader (who I don't know who he was), I turned to face Loany, she was a bit worried, I gave her a kiss on her cheek and hugged her. We kept moving, and then I woke up.#
