Trip to the Red Moon#Monday, August 09, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a very interesting dream, it was a little long, even though what I recall is not so much.

What I remember most is being in some kind of rocket with some other people, my brother I think, Otto and some girl I can't remember who. They were sending us on an exploration mission to the moon.

The trip was long and we encountered many problems but we managed to land on the ''landing'' site that was specified, which was in front of a graveyard and a weird small house. Many parts of the moon where raid, it wasn't the ordinary Moon. When we arrived everyone got out except me, I was still communicating with the people over The Earth, inside the ship. I saw everyone start to explore around, through the window. And I saw that Otto knocked on the small house's door. A little creature came out, it was like a boy but really angry and didn't seem very human. It started growling and screeching around, and then I woke up.#
