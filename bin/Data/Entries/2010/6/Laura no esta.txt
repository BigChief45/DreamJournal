Laura no esta#jueves, 24 de junio de 2010#Normal Dream#None#It was a weird dream, from what I remember:

The setting started at my school, in a classroom. We were all there just talking to each other, and there was Laura Andino, a huge crush of mine some years ago. I went to talk to her and we spent some time talking. After a while, the setting changed and we were driving in my dad's Mercedes, then the car morphed to another car. Next (the most bizzarre part), we were speeding on a highway, somehow Laura sneezed and let go a booger that got sticked in the car, she tried removing it but it wouldn't come out, she then (somehow) stepped in the part where the window sits, and fell of the car into the road. I pressed the breaks immediatly, horrified. I put reverse and went back to get her, she was all beat up, with bruises and bleeding, it was bad. Just immediatly the police came over to check on what had just happened, Laura couldn't speak well and I tried to explain what happened, they didn't believe me and where accusing me responsible of this.

During all this time, it seemed I was on a ''free period'' of class, in other words: In a couple of minutes I had to go to class and we where just enjoying me free time.

Other parts of the dream that I do remember, but can't assemble them in a correct chronological order:

I'm sure I was spending time with Laura at some house, very nice and big house, just in a room, alone, laughing and talking, helding hands. And thats about all I can remember for now.

So listing some Dream Characters in this dream:
- Laura Andino
- Policemen (unknown and non important faces)#
