My poor journal...#Thursday, October 07, 2010#Normal Dream#None#Very entertaining dream, with a few missed dreamsigns too. I can only remember a frew fragments of it though.

I remember being with my brother in some kind of ghost town, it felt very similar to a videogame, like Silent Hill. It was just the two of us and we were exploring house by house. It was said that aliens had abducted or killed everyone who lived in that down. Indeed there was something in that ghost town watching us, I could feel it. We were armed and ready for anything that would pop up. 

And I jus't can remember what else happenes in this fragment, and I can't arrange coherently the even smaller fragments of this one.

Now we where in our house. They yelled from downstairs that lunch was ready. I was busy working on something, I heard the yell and came down. There was my mom my dad and my grandmother (who lives next door) already at the table, all the food was placed on the table already. My brother arrived just a minute after. Before I could start eating I saw a very small notebook on one of the chairs, I took it and instantly realized (in my dream) that it was my DJ. (The funny thing is, I don't have a DJ as a notebook, plus the cover of the DJ in the dream was exactly like the cover of a notebook I used for math problems). I took it and opened it, it I saw that somebody else had written stuff on it, dream related stuff and non dream related stuff too, judging by the handwriting, it was my brother. I got so pissed, I yelled and cussed at him, I asked him why the f***k was he doing with my personal stuff. He didn't answer, and then my dad told me to calm down, I didn't: ''I'm not going to chill, It's not fair, this is personal to me, would you (addressing my dad) be calmed if I took your own personal sh**t and do whatever I want with it?''. He looked at me, he knew I was right, so he said nothing.#
