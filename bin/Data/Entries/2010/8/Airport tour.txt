Airport tour#Tuesday, August 03, 2010#Normal Dream#None#The dream took place mostly in an airport-like facility. I recall being with my family including my family from Maryland in an airport that was very much alike to a mall.

The main scene from the dream was when we got to an elevator, there were many people gathered around, like making line. The elevator was just like Tower of Terror, except without any seats. Somehow out of nowhere my friend Tony appeared, and he decided to take the ride. I looked outside from one of the big windows and saw Melanie, so I went to talk her. She was looking sexy as hell, so we started talking, and at the same time, Tony was riding the elevator, but I could see what was happening inside the elevator at the same time I was talking to Melanie. The feeling inside the elevator where vivid but I didn't experience dizziness or things of the sort.

After talking to Melanie I started making out with her for a while. Then we were walking on a street, just outside the airport and I told Otto about it, he said he made out with her too, quite a few times.

And then the dream ended.#
