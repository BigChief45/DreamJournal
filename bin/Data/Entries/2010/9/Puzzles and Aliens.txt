Puzzles and Aliens#Friday, September 24, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a very long dream, but it was interesting.

I think it started like this: We were on vacations with my family. We traveled in some sort of spaceship, it was huge, Rodrigo (my cousin) was with us. We landed the spaceship (funny thing is we never went to outer space) in a weird place and everyone got out. We started exploring the place, it was like a big construction site, except it had one house and people lived in it (yay neighboors :P).

Apparently my dad wanted to start building right next to the existing house, so they went to check the terrain, and started bringing all the machinery, we all went to the terrain to check it out. And this is where I know there was something there but I just can't seem to remember.

After that, everyone was going to go back to the ship, Rodrigo and me where the first ones to head in. We noticed something was wrong, the controls had been altered, later my dad came in and we told him. He took a look and indeed something was just not right. ''Intruders'' he said, we started looking for them and we found them, they were like huge insects with guns (Very similar to District 9), we fought back and managed to kill them all, we took control of the ship again. And left.

Later, I saw myself chatting with a girl that was with us at the trip, we talked about how we went to see the terrain site and what was there (which I can't remember!). I tried adding her to my contact list but It wouldn't let me, I tried several times, and I gave up.

Now I was on another scene, I was with Rodrigo and some other male friends, we where in some sort of haunted house. It was all dark and nobody was there, it was a little scary. As we explored around the house we started to find weird things inside, like symbols that teleported us to different places around the house, it required a puzzle to be solved for each symbol, as we found more, the puzzles began getting more complex. We were in one of the house's bathroom on the 2nd floor (or even higher, can't tell) and we examined the bathroom carefully, the walls were all in bad state, with scratches, there was a bath stuff with stains and full of dirt. Anyways something caught my eye in the window, there was like a spider web covering the whole area of the window, I kept staring at it and it seemed like the spider turned into a whirpool from time to time. I said to the others: ''Here jump, quick!''. I jumped through the window and instantly I found myself in some sort of spooky garden with tombs all around, it took a while to see my friends appear with me, seems like they weren't too convinced of my idea :P .

And then I woke up.#
