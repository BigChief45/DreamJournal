Docks and Beach#Saturday, August 14, 2010#Normal Dream#None#I couldn't recall much of this dream because I was woken up by my dad. But I remember It had World of Warcraft elements, and some elements and feelings of previous dreams. I remember being on a beach at night, the sky was crimson red and there was some sort of battle between some giants.

And thats basically all I can remember from this dream.#
