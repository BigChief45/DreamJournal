Nighty Road Trip#Tuesday, September 14, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a very interesting and enjoyable dream.

I remember the setting being nighttime. We were with some friends at some kind of resort, we were many, including people I didn't knew very much. We were planning on going on road trip to a beach some hours from here. We got on a bus located on a parking lot. And started heading towards our destination, the trip at the bus was really weird, there were ALOT of people on the streets, like they didn't care about the vehicles crossing; Children playing in the middle of the street, adults walking, etc.

We arrived at a beach, it was still nighttime. There were many discos where we were. We stayed near the shore, watching all the people pass by and the lights inside the discos. I noticed there was some sort of girl fight at a disco and alarmed the others, we got closer to get a better look. The fight ended and one of the girls left, we returned to the shore.

Then some white girl with black long hair and blue jean shorts came and sat down near us, she had a suspicious look and smile. She seemed injured, so I approached her without hesitation and asked her if she was alright, she coldly said no and rejected me. But I kept talking with her and she warmed a bit. I took her to a room filled with glass that contained water and we kept talking, I woke up at this time.#
