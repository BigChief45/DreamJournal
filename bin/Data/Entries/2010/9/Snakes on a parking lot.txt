Snakes on a parking lot#Wednesday, September 15, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This dream was sort of a recurring dream, because when I woke up I knew I had dreamed this already, although this dream specifically contained more details than the last of its same kind.

I don't remember the first events, just the last ones. I remember being in some kind of parking lot at nighttime with someone. It was a restaurant's parking lot, and we where near the drive-through. The person who was with me was my friend in my dream, but I don't know that person in Waking Life.

Anyways, we were trying to break through some sort of security system that the restaurant had. It needed some sort of password, my friend told me I should distract the cameras that where watching us, so I did. At this point the Dream Camera switched to my friend in 1st and 3rd person. My friend was cracking the code when somehow a snake appeared and bite a foot finger (No shoes? Possibly missed  dream sign >_< ).

He started to bleed but the wound wasn't that bad, it seemed it hurt alot though.

Before all this happened I also remember a black woman following us around the parking lot, she wanted something but I can't recall what it was.#
