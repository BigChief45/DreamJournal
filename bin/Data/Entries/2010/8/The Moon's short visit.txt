The Moon's short visit#Saturday, August 07, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This was a short dream, and I wasn't able to recall much from it, so this is going to be a really really short entry.

The dream was very similar to last night in Waking Life, we went to party and hang out at Los Proceres with Tony and the rest. I don't recall anything unusual in the dream but I think Luna was present somewhere in the dream, I'm 100% sure of that.

Well, thats it.#
