My first RC#Friday, August 06, 2010#Normal Dream#None#This is one of the most interesting dreams I've had. It is a long dream and its hard to recall most of the parts, considering there are many many settings and the chronological order is hard to determine, I'll just do my best to try and gather everything possible.

First, I remember being in some kind of big house. There was some sort of party going on, many people arrived and left constantly. At some point, Alejandra Urquia arrived and started flirting and doing stuff, we were in a big hall that was very tall, the celing was meters above from us. And she kept throwing toys to the ceiling.

Afterwards, I remember leaving that house in my car, I was with somebody, but I can't remember who. We were walking to the parking lot where my car was, there were few cars there, like 3 or 4 including mine. We got in the car, started it and drove away from the parking lot. The road was made of rocks and sand, and when we got to a point where it was going a little downhill, someone rapidly came running from behind, so we stopped. It was Gabriel Haddad, he said that we hit his car on our way out, but that was not true. We convinced him and he accepted it, he stayed there and talked for a while. Suddenly another car comes opposite of to where we were going. They cannot pass since we are blocking the way (it was a one lane road), so they get out. I remember Maria Fernanda Rubio got out of the car, and Alejandra Toro, maybe Carlos Arias too but I'm not too sure of that. We talked for a while and stayed there, after some time, everyone made their separate ways.

When all those people came, Tony also came along, And he joined us. He said we should go to his place. So we were driving to his place, it was very solitary, there were few houses, the place was mostly made of forrest and roads that connected the houses. It was a little late by now, when we arrived, Tony's brother was greeting us outside the house (Tony doesn't even have a brother, RC for next time). In this dream Tony's brother was Carlos Perez.

So the next part of the dream was probably the weirdest and the most complicated to describe, and the fact that I don't recall much from it makes it harder, it was really strange, so I'm not going to write it down.

The final part, we were in some kind of bar/restaurant. I remember Cali being there for sure, Luna too. And some other people which I think where Luna's friends. We were all hanging out and about to eat. Cali calls me apart from the group like if wanting to say something important, so we leave my chair. He says something about Luna, which I didn't hear correctly, I heard something about my ex. He refuses to repeat and we both go to the order our food, while Luna and the others stay talking at the table. I ask him again and he tells me that the guy who Luna is talking with right now is the guy that Luna likes. I turn around to see at the table at this guy with gray t-shirt talking to Luna. Suddenly images of his facebook profile cross my mind and suddenly go away (too much facebook maybe?). I get a little upset but I don't let that take the best of me. And if I'm not mistaken, suddenly after that, I woke up.

I remember doing a reality check somewhere in the dream, and it working. I became lucid for a few seconds, I remember breathing deeply and slowly, thinking thougts to help keep the lucidity, however this didnt't work. I didn't wake up though, I guess its at least something.#
