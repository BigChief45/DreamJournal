Pizza delivery and my promotion#Sunday, September 26, 2010#Normal Dream#None#I remember living in some kind of city, but my house was a located near a mountain and you could see the city from there. One day I had to make an errand to the supermarket, so I went with my bike, bought the stuff and left, since I was new in the city I didn't know the roads very well, so I got lost, I had taken the wrong turn and ended up in a weird place, I saw a little house so I approached for directions. I knocked and they let me in, there were two girls inside, one was behind a desk writing stuff and the other was sitting infront of the desk like waiting for something.

I told them I was lost and they showed me a map, I saw where I had made my mistake. We started talking about stuff (random talk, can't remember) and it seems they owned a pizza delivery business, they offered me a spot. I told them It wouldn't be a good idea since I was new and didn't know the city very well. They told me it was ok, and they where gonna hire me still. So they wrote my name in a big yellow notebook the girl behind the desk had and left.

[Scene change]

It was a different city now, it was nightime. I was living with my cousing Rodrigo, and we were involved in the Mafia and stuff like that,we did jobs for certain people which consisted sometimes in stealing or killing targets. It was very similar to Grand Theft Auto. The only job I remember was driving to a tall red building near some docks, we parked our car on the sides. I went to a crane vehicle and brought back to the building, we parked it by the side too. Rodrigo climbed the building and attached the crane to something which I never knew what it was, I just knew that it was our objective. The target also was inside with his family, it seemed he was a big mafioso.

I got on the crane vehicle, turned on the car and started accelerating, finally the thing on top of the building broke and hit the floor, I accelerated and let the crane vehicle crash in to the ocean. Everyone hid and waited for the target to come out of the house, when he did and saw what happened, the coward quickly jumped into his car and tried to ran away. We chased him with our car and finally got him, we hit him from behind and he lost control and crashed. It looked awful and it was almost 100% sure he was dead, so we left the crime scene.

And then I woke up#
